# Part 1 – Data Management for Integrated Hydrologic Model Development

This **40-hour course** is designed for hydrological modelers, GIS specialists, and hydrogeologists working with the integrated surface–subsurface flow model **HydroGeoSphere (HGS)**.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, participants will be able to:

- **Identify, acquire and prepare** relevant GIS datasets for hydrogeological modeling
- **Automate GIS workflows** for large-scale or repeated model builds  
- **Understand best practices** when using GIS data in HGS
- **Introduction to important GIS tools**

## Course Team

- **Course Coordinator:** Guido V.
- **Exercise Moderator:** Eric (Messenger board? Teams?)

## Course Overview

This course covers the essential data management skills needed for integrated hydrologic modeling with HGS, including:

- **Module 1:** Introduction to HGS and GIS Roles in Modeling (3 hrs)
- **Module 2:** Watershed Delineation and Model Boundary (3 hrs)  
- **Module 3:** Digital Elevation Models (3 hrs)
- **Module 4:** Geology Datasets (3 hrs)
- **Module 5:** Land Surface and Hydrological Datasets (3 hrs)
- **Module 7:** Climate Datasets (3 hrs)
- **Module 8:** Finite Element Mesh (3 hrs)
- **Module X:** Automation and Scripting GIS Workflows (3 hrs)
- **Module Y:** Case Study Example (3 hrs)
- **Module 10:** Monitoring Data (3 hrs)

Each module combines theoretical concepts with hands-on practical exercises using real-world datasets and industry-standard tools.
