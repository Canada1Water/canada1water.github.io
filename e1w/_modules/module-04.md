# Module 4: Geology Datasets
**Duration:** 3 hours  
**Instructors:** Eric Kessel, Amanda Taylor

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
- Understand the different types of geological materials relevant to HGS modeling
- Distinguish between soils, surficial geology, and bedrock geology
- Work with depth to bedrock datasets
- Apply appropriate material properties to geological units
- Integrate geological datasets into HGS models

## Module Content

### 4.1 Soils – Near Surface Unconsolidated Materials

- Hydraulic conductivity and porosity of soils
- Soil depth and variability

### 4.2 Surficial Geology – Unconsolidated Materials  
- Quaternary deposits
- Glacial and post-glacial materials
- Alluvial and colluvial deposits
- Mapping surficial geology units

### 4.3 Bedrock Geology – Consolidated Materials
- Bedrock formation mapping
- Structural geology considerations
- Fracture and fault systems
- Rock mass properties

### 4.4 Depth to Bedrock – Elevation of Consolidated Materials
- Bedrock topography mapping
- Interpolation techniques
- Uncertainty quantification
- Integration with overburden thickness

### 4.5 Material Properties
