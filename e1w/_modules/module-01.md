# Module 1: Introduction to HGS and GIS Roles in Modeling
**Duration:** 3 hours  
**Instructors:** Guido Vettoretti, Brayden McNeill, Steven Frey

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
- Understand the overall course structure and objectives
- Comprehend HGS model architecture and requirements
- Identify the essential GIS layers needed for HGS modeling
- Recognize common data sources for hydrogeological modeling
- Apply coordinate reference system (CRS) and reprojection concepts
- Distinguish between different data formats used in modeling

## Module Content

### Course Introduction (Guido Vettoretti)
- Course overview and learning objectives
- Introduction to presenters and course structure
- Overview of the modeling workflow from data to simulation

### HGS Model Structure Overview (Brayden McNeill / Steven Frey)
- How HydroGeoSphere works fundamentally
- What data inputs are required for HGS
- Understanding the integrated surface-subsurface approach
- How we generate the readable layers that HGS needs

### Essential GIS Layers for HGS (Brayden McNeill / Steven Frey)
- **Watershed delineation** - defining model boundaries
- **Elevation data** - digital elevation models and terrain analysis
- **Land surface characteristics** - land cover and surface properties
- **Geological data** - subsurface material properties
- **Hydrological features** - streams, lakes, and water bodies
- **Climate data** - precipitation, temperature, and evapotranspiration
- Introduction to Python tools for data processing

### Common Data Sources (Brayden McNeill / Steven Frey)
- **HydroSheds** - global hydrological data
- **WorldCover** - global land cover mapping
- **SoilGrids** - global soil information
- **LAI Copernicus** - leaf area index data

- Importance of consistent projections in modeling
- Best practices for reprojection workflows
- Common CRS issues and solutions

### Data Formats and Standards
- **Vector data** - points, lines, polygons
- **Raster data** - gridded spatial data
- **Gridded time series** - temporal data integration
- **ISO 19115** - Geographic information metadata standards

### Data Management Best Practices
