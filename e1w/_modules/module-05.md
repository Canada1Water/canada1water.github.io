# Module 5: Land Surface and Hydrological Datasets
**Duration:** 3 hours  
**Instructors:** Eric Kessel, Amanda Taylor

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
- Delineate stream networks and determine channel properties
- Identify and characterize lakes and waterbodies
- Work with land cover datasets for overland flow modeling
- Understand and apply Leaf Area Index (LAI) data
- Integrate surface hydrological features into HGS models

## Module Content

### 5.1 Stream Delineation and Channel Properties

- Stream-aquifer interactions

### 5.2 Lakes and Waterbodies
- Waterbody identification and classification
- Lake bathymetry and volume estimation
- Seasonal water level variations
- Lake-groundwater interactions

### 5.3 Land Cover and Overland Flow Properties
- Land cover classification systems
- Overland flow parameters
- Surface roughness estimation
- Urban vs. natural surface characteristics

### 5.4 Leaf Area Index (LAI)
- LAI datasets and temporal variations
- Relationship to evapotranspiration
- Seasonal patterns and trends
- Integration with climate forcing

## Practical Exercises
